# crypto_course_lab

This project was requested to the (computer science) students of 
the Cryptography Course Lab that I have been teaching 
in fall 2012/2013 at the University of Trento.

It is the simulation of an encrypted comunication of a server and a client
through two pipes.
For the details read the specification of the project in the file:
